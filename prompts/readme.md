In this folder you put all your prompt files.

The prompt file you want to use should be specified in the .env file with the PROMPT_USED variable.

Example .env file for the prompt file in `prompts/v1.md`:
```
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=replace-with-your-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=replace-with-your-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=replace-with-your-key
PROMPT_USED="v1.md"
```
